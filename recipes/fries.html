<h3>Straight out of the freezer and better than fast food fries without the guilt of deep-frying. Feel free to use your preferred frozen French fry cut but keep in mind that steak-cut or crinkle will take a couple minutes longer.</h3>
<h1>Fries ingredients</h1><br><br>

<ul><li>½ (16 ounce) package frozen French fries</li>
<li>1 ½ teaspoons olive oil</li><li>¼ teaspoon salt</li></ul>
<br><br>
<h1>Steps</h1>
<br><br>
<ol><li>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
<li>Place frozen French fries in a large bowl. Add olive oil and toss to coat. Season with salt and toss to coat again.</li>
<li>Spread out French fries in the basket of the air fryer, making sure to not overcrowd, and cook for 10 minutes. Turn fries over using a spatula and continue cooking until desired crispness, 2 to 4 minutes more.</li>

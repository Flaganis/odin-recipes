    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="../images/lasagna.webp" alt="Lasagna Camelopardalis" style=" border-radius: 900px; height: 600px; width: auto;">
<h3>A rich and creamy whole-wheat pasta dish filled layer by layer with refreshingly fresh onions and garlic,
    <br> lathered in a succulent sauce and topped with imported, premium quality girafella.
<br><br>

This recipe has simple ingredients but tons of flavor with a creamy ricotta mixture, savory meat sauce, and lots of mozzarella cheese. 
<br>This is a great freezer meal, make-ahead recipe, and leftovers freeze and reheat super well.<br><br></h3>
<h1>Lasagna ingredients</h1><br><br>

<ul "><li>Cheese Filling: For this classic lasagna recipe, the cheese filling has ricotta and parmesan with seasonings. You can make homemade ricotta cheese or replace it with cottage cheese.</li>
<li>Meat: I use both Italian sausage and ground beef for great flavor. If using all beef, add ¼ teaspoon of fennel seeds and some Italian seasoning to the meat mixture for flavor, or make my homemade Italian sausage.</li><li>Sauce: To keep this sauce quick, I use pasta sauce or marinara sauce (it’s easy to make from scratch with crushed tomatoes and canned tomatoes if you’d prefer). If using store-bought sauce, I love Rao’s for flavor.</li></ul>
<br><br>
<h1>Steps</h1>
<br><br>
<ol><li>Boil pasta: In a large pot of salted water boil lasagna noodles.</li>
<li>Prepare meat sauce: Cook sausage and beef with onion and garlic. Drain well, add the pasta sauce & simmer it for a few minutes to thicken.</li>
<li>Combine cheese mixture: Stir the cheese mixture together in a bowl.</li>
<li>Layer & bake: Layer the meat sauce and cheese mixture with lasagna noodles and bake until the top of the lasagna is golden brown.</li>
</ol>
